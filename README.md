# Modflux

Modflux is a prepaid execution layer for AI agents.

It powers Sentinel by enforcing paid, auditable execution on-chain.

## What Modflux Is

Modflux is not an NFT collection.

It is a consumable execution system where:
- Each NFT represents execution capacity
- Each successful AI task burns one charge
- Burned charges are permanent and on-chain

No burn means no execution.

---

## What Modflux Is Not

- Not art
- Not access passes
- Not a subscription
- Not a free service

---

## How Execution Works

1. A user mints a Modflux NFT
2. The NFT contains a fixed number of charges
3. Sentinel performs a real task
4. One charge is burned on-chain
5. When charges reach zero, the NFT is destroyed

Execution only happens when paid for.

---

## Pricing & Supply

Pricing and supply are enforced on-chain.

- Common: 3 executions
- Rare: 5 executions
