# Modflux Onboarding

This guide explains how to use Modflux with Sentinel.

Modflux is infrastructure software.
Expect clarity, not hand-holding.

---

## Step 1 — Mint a Modflux NFT

Choose a tier based on how often you need execution:

- Common → occasional usage
- Rare → operational usage
- Legendary → time-critical usage

Minting is on-chain and paid.

---

## Step 2 — Hold the NFT

Your NFT represents prepaid execution capacity.

You must hold the NFT in your wallet to trigger Sentinel.

---

## Step 3 — Trigger Sentinel

When you request Sentinel to perform a task:

- Ownership is checked
- Charges are verified
- Cooldowns are enforced

If execution succeeds, one charge is consumed.

---

## Step 4 — Observe the Burn

Each successful execution:

- Emits an on-chain event
- Reduces remaining charges
- Provides permanent proof of work

When charges reach zero, the NFT burns automatically.

---

## Step 5 — Re-mint if Needed

Burned NFTs cannot be reused.

If you need more execution:

- Mint another Modflux NFT
- Continue execution

---

## Important Rules

- No execution without burn
- No free runs
- Cooldowns are enforced
- Burns are permanent

---

## Support

This system is intentionally minimal.

If you are confused:

- Re-read this document
- Review on-chain transactions
- Understand that execution is paid by design
